"""
Shared pytest fixtures for database testing.

These fixtures provide transaction-based test isolation:
- Each test runs inside a transaction that gets rolled back
- Tests are fast because no data persists between tests
- Tests are isolated because each starts with clean state

USAGE:
    # For API tests (needs both session and client):
    def test_endpoint(get_session_client):
        session, client = get_session_client
        response = client.get("/health")
        assert response.status_code == 200

    # For DAO/database unit tests:
    async def test_dao(isolated_session):
        dao = MyDAO(isolated_session)
        result = await dao.create(...)

    # For API tests without database:
    def test_simple_endpoint(isolated_client):
        response = isolated_client.get("/health")
        assert response.status_code == 200
